In this talk, you will get an overview on how to create and use extension functions in your Kotlin code as well as how it interops with existing Java code. You will then be taken on a tour across common areas of Android where extension functions work wonders in making your code more concise and less prone to bugs. Transitioning from Java to Kotlin can be tricky so we will go through some of the best practices when doing the migration. By the end of the session, you will have a better understanding on what Kotlin and extension functions can do for you as well as some of the pitfalls that need to be kept in mind.",
